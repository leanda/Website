        <p class="text-display">Designer. Tinkerer. Builder.</p>
        <p class="text-lg" style="max-width: var(--max-width-text);">I'm Leanda — a designer with thirty years of experience and a lifelong habit of taking things apart to see how they work. I started with a ZX81 my dad brought home in a supermarket bag, went to art school, taught myself to code, and somewhere along the way built a software company that someone else eventually wanted to buy. I work at the intersection of design and technology, consulting, planning, designing and building things that are bespoke, considered, and made to last. If you're looking for someone who genuinely understands both sides, let's talk.</p>
