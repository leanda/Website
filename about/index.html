            <p>My career started the way most good things do, accidentally. My dad brought home a Sinclair ZX81 in a supermarket shopping bag when I was young, and something clicked. By the time I got to art school, studying Interactive Arts at Manchester Metropolitan University, I was already deep into Amigas, Deluxe Paint, and Apple Macs. Then, towards the end of my degree in the late nineties, a small module on the internet changed everything. We built an art piece using HTML and CSS, and I knew immediately that this was where I wanted to be.</p>
            <p>I've been freelance for most of my career, working with arts organisations, creative individuals, and a wide range of clients who needed someone who could think about design and technology together rather than separately. I've always built and coded things myself, prototyped ideas, and stayed close to whatever was emerging. Not because it was strategically useful, but because I'm genuinely curious.</p>
            <p>About ten years ago, a friend I'd met on Twitter asked me to co-found a company with him. That company was Housing Online, and over the following decade we designed and built tenant portal software and websites for housing associations across the UK. I'm proud of what we made, particularly the design of the software itself, and proud that we built something valuable enough for another company to want to acquire.</p>
            <p>Now in my fourth decade of working in design and technology, this site is a retrospective of sorts, and also a reflection of how I still work. Alongside my professional commitments I take on creative and consultancy projects that interest me, the kind of work that's bespoke and considered, where I can consult closely with the people I'm working with rather than reach for an off-the-shelf answer. I've just turned 50, and if anything my curiosity has only grown. I'm as interested in what's coming next as I was the day my dad walked through the door with that computer in a bag.</p>
